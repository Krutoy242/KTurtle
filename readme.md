Now the tough turtle is able not only to quickly build gigantic volumes, but also to team up with other cool turtles for joint construction.

Also, a crowd of tough turtles can dig as well as an advanced drilling rig!

Below you can see how cool turtles printed a model made in the MagicaVoxel program. Construction with 25 turtles took ~ 10 minutes.
